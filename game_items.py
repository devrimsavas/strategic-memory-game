ABOUT GAME

This game brings some strategic features to the classic memory game.
While I was planning the game,
I actually planned a standard algorithm for beginners to show how to make
an easy memory game. But while i was writing my codes, i wanted to add some new
strategy elements to have fun. The hardest part was to find drawings and edit them
with photoshop.

First, I decide pre-made
characters in photoshop to prepare the cards. I designed the playing cards. However,
i did not like them and suddenly i thought i might use medieval theme and elements 
I edited the graphics that I found on the
internet with photoshop add color etc. The game is still not finished,

I did some programming and graphics tricks because Python's tkinter interface is
not very
flexible and not ideal for gaming. However, as a result, i really enjoyed while i
was writing my codes. 

In memory of the Amiga game "Turn it" that I saw in the first computer magazine I bought at the end of May 1990.
